        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          Disclaimer: This project is meant for learning purpose. I learned this project on a Youtube Channel called Fireship by Jeff Delaney. You can check his github project here in: https://github.com/fireship-io/threejs-scroll-animation-demo/blob/main/style.css
        </p>

        <p>
          I started this learning project on the beginning of February and finished it on February 16, 2022. I hope to learn more about three.js and the different libraries in regards to front-end development. Right now, I am doing an internship for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints
          as a Quality Assurance Engineer Intern. I like it, but I still want to explore more career paths while I am still in college. I love working both back-end and front-end so I will keep learning and uploading everything on my GitHub profile.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am currently studying BS Computer Engineering in Brigham Young University - Idaho. I am expected to graduate on Spring of 2023. I hope by that time, I will have enough experience to create my own projects such as this.
          I am still pondering about making my own YouTube videos too!!
